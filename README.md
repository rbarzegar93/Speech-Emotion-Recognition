# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Emotions play an extremely important role in human mental life. It is a medium of expression of one's perspective or one's mental state to others. Speech Emotion Detection can be defined as extraction of the emotional state of the speaker from his or her speech signal. Recognizing human emotions is a very complex task in itself because of the ambiguity in classifying the acted and natural emotions.

In this project, I tried different approaches to detect the emotion of the speakers in my audio files. Different machine learning techniques have been applied to create recognition agents including logistic regression, convolutional neural network. To process a voice signal, there are techniques that can be broadly classified as either time-domain or frequency-domain approaches.
